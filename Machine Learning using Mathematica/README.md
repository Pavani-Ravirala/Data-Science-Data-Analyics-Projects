# Machine Learning using Mathematica
A simple project in Mathematica that uses the Palmer Penguins dataset to illustrate the ways in which we can use Mathematica functions to do some exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, data pre-processing and finally apply Machine Learning models to predict the type of penguin using algorithms like Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Neural Networks.
