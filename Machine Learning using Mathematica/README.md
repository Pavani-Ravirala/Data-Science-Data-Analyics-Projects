# Machine Learning using Mathematica
A simple project in Mathematica that illustrates the ways we can use Mathematica function to do some data analysis, data cleaning, data pre-processing and finally apply Machine Learning models to predict the type of penguin using algorithms like Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Neural Networks.
